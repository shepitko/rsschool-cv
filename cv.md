## About me
I like challenges, create something new, refactor legacy, and carefully checked it.

I'm strong experienced on JS technologies related to Frontend(React/Apollo/Redux) and Backend(Node.js/GraphQL/PostgreSQL). 

I've worked a lot with Ruby(RoR/API), raw ruby(scrapers, data processing). I'll give you the correct estimation, and I'm ready to share my experience/ideas with colleagues and clients(if needed).

I would like to work with clients who like responsible developers and fully trust my experience. And I promise not to let you down

## Work with
* Vanilla JS
* React + Redux/MobX
* Graphql(apollo client)
* Node.js
* Pure SQL-query/ Postgresql / Redis
* Ruby/RoR

## Code example
Multi-layout was created/implemented by me.

I think for understanding this doc will be enough

```
/**
 * Routes config
 * with multi-layouts
 *
 * by this config we are generating Routes
 * like a <Route path={routeLink} element={<SomeComponent />} />
 */

/**
 * Structure:
 *
 * key: String, required - must be uniq string
 * layout: Func, required - design wrapper/Component for scoupe of routes
 * subRoutes: [ - list of routes
 *   key: String, required - must be uniq string
 *   path: String, required  - router's link / url path
 *   element: Component - element of route
 *   auth: Bool  - use <AuthRoute /> instead of <Route />
 *   permission, String/Array - list of permissions or permission, use only for AuthRoute
 * ]
